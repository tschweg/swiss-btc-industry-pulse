# Concept and Design

This document explains some thoughts behind the design of the survey.


## Goal & Motivation

To deepen the understanding of the Bitcoin industry in Switzerland. We believe 
that gathering and openly sharing accurate, current insights can help the 
community gain a clearer understanding of the evolving landscape, tackle 
challenges, and capitalize on opportunities. Through this survey, we aim to 
contribute value to the Swiss Bitcoin community, providing benefits to both 
current and future stakeholders—including businesses, policymakers, 
researchers, and investors.

## Guiding principles

### 1. Openness

We are committed to openness and clarity in all our actions. By openly sharing 
data, insights, methodologies and tools, we aim to foster a culture of 
transparency that benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and helps stakeholders 
make well-informed decisions.

### 2. Verifiability

We believe in the power of collective knowledge and community-driven progress, 
which is why we aim to opensource everything we do.

### 3. Integrity

We uphold the highest standards of data integrity and ethical conduct. 
Respecting the privacy and preferences of our participants is paramount, and we 
ensure that data is handled with care and used responsibly to advance the 
industry’s best interests.



## Concept
- Structured survey among Swiss companies in the Bitcoin space
- Survey is conducted and evaluated on a quarterly basis
- Any company offering Bitcoin related services can participate as long as 
  bitcoin is part of their value creation process in some shape or form
- Participation requires registration to avoid spam
- Participant answers will be shared publicly by default (open data approach)


## Open source and open data

Both the survey questions and the collected data will be shared publicly. 
Survey participants have the option to opt-out with each survey run.
